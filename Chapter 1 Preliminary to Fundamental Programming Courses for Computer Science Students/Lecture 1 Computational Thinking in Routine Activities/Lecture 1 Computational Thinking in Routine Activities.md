Hi!

Welcome to *Preliminary to Fundamental Programming Courses for Computer Science Students*.

Today, we are going to discuss *Computational Thinking in Routine Activities*.

But before we get started, I would like to share the motivation of this preliminary.

In university, fundamental programming courses often guide computer science students to solve elementary problems based on specific programming languages such as C and Python. 

So you are expected to have basic comprehension of algorithm analysis before those courses, and sufficient thoughtful practice instead of repetitive exercise is also required.

However, as educational background can significantly influence cognitive style, we have discovered that numerous students are hindered in those courses by their prior knowledge rather than by programming in itself.

That is, the main challenge of fundamental programming courses is not the grammar of programming languages, but to think like a computer scientist.

Therefore, this preliminary focuses on the abilities and concepts that beginners often overlook. We advise you to take this lecture if needed after checking its abstract. And participation for verifying your understanding of programming is encouraged.
